summary: 
abstract: "Service-level objectives (SLOs), as network performance requirements for delay and packet loss typically, should be guaranteed for increasing high-performance applications, e.g., telesurgery and cloud gaming. However, SLO violations are common and destructive in todayâ€™s network operation. Detection and diagnosis, meaning monitoring performance to discover anomalies and analyzing causality of SLO violations respectively, are crucial for fast recovery. Unfortunately, existing diagnosis approaches require exhaustive causal information to function. Meanwhile, existing detection tools incur large overhead or are only able to provide limited information for diagnosis. This paper presents DOVE, a diagnosis-driven SLO detection system with high accuracy and low overhead. The key idea is to identify and report the information needed by diagnosis along with SLO violation alerts from the data plane selectively and efficiently. Network segmentation is introduced to balance scalability and accuracy. Novel algorithms to measure packet loss and percentile delay are implemented completely on the data plane without the involvement of the control plane for fine-grained SLO detection. We implement and deploy DOVE on Tofino and P4 software switch (BMv2) and show the effectiveness of DOVE with a use case. The reported SLO violation alerts and diagnosis-needing information are compared with ground truth and show high accuracy (>97%). Our evaluation also shows that DOVE introduces up to two orders of magnitude less traffic overhead than NetSight. In addition, memory utilization and required processing ability are low to be deployable in real network topologies."
