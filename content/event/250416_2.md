summary: 
abstract: "Many software testing papers claim to discover bugs but without providing sufficient evidence. My analysis of 39 papers from top conferences revealed that only 51% provide complete bug identifiers and 28% have inaccessible artifacts. Their terminology in reporting practices is being analyzed too. In the future, I plan to develop BugAgreement, a novel metric to quantify researcher-developer consensus on bug reports, which could help enable rigorous evaluation of bug-finding techniques and promote transparency in software testing research."
