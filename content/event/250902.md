summary: 
abstract: "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for static bug and vulnerability detection, offering complementary insights to traditional static analysis. In this talk, I will present our recent work on LLM-based static bug detection, highlighting how LLMs can extend the knowledge boundary of static analysis to achieve higher precision and recall in bug detection. Moreover, I will also discuss the promise and the limitations of LLMs in practical vulnerability detection."
