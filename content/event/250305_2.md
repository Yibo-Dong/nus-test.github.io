summary: 
abstract: "The PHP interpreter, powering over 70% of websites on the internet, plays a crucial role in web development.
Existing approaches to finding bugs in PHP primarily focus on detecting explicit security issues through
crashes or sanitizer-based oracles, but fail to identify logic bugs that silently lead to incorrect results. We
observe that the introduction of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation mode in PHP presents an opportunity for
differential testing, as it provides an alternative implementation of the same language specification. To leverage
this opportunity, we propose DiffPHP, an automatic differential testing framework that efficiently detects
logic bugs in the PHP interpreter by comparing JIT and non-JIT execution results. Our differential testing
incorporates two key techniques: program state instrumentation for fine-grained execution state comparison,
and dual verification to handle non-deterministic behaviors in PHP programs. Combined with a state-of-theart test case generation, these two techniques significantly reduce false alarms while maintaining high bug
detection capability. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffPHP outperforms the official test suite used in
PHPâ€™s continuous integration, achieving higher code coverage and executing more Zend opcodes. Through
ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of both program state instrumentation and dual verification
components. To date, DiffPHP has identified 35 previously unknown logic bugs in the PHP interpreter, with
25 already fixed and 5 confirmed by PHP developers. DiffPHP has been acknowledged by the PHP developers,
and offers a practical tool for automatically discovering logic bugs in the PHP interpreter."
